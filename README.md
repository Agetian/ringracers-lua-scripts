# ringracers-lua-scripts
Various small LUA scripts for Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers:

DL_BotCosmetics.pk3 - A very simple script that makes bots use skins and followers in Online mode
DL_BotSliptide.pk3 - A [cheaty and hacky as heck] script that makes bots use sliptide (v2.3) and even wavedash sometimes (v2.4+ git) when having enough boost. Very experimental.
