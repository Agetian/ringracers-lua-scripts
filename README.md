# ringracers-lua-scripts
Various small LUA scripts for Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers:

DL_BotCosmetics.pk3 - A very simple script that makes bots use skins and followers in Online mode.
DL_BotCosmetics_v24.pk3 - A version of the bot cosmetics script above that aims for compatibility with v2.4rc1 and newer.
DL_BotSliptide.pk3 - A [cheaty and hacky as heck] script that makes bots use sliptide (v2.3) and even wavedash sometimes (v2.4+ git) when having enough boost. Very experimental.
DL_BotSliptide_v24.pk3 - A [cheaty and hacky as heck] script that makes bots use sliptide and wavedash. Very experimental. Compatible with v2.4rc1 and hopefully newer.
